In this guide, we'll walk you through the essential features of the Remnawave Panel, helping you get up and running quickly.  
We will cover every step, from your first login to the Panel to importing a subscription into a client application.

:::warning Note

- This guide is written for Panel **version 2.0** and newer.
- This guide also assumes that you have already installed Remnawave and its components.
- Some UI elements have changed their appearance in recent updates, but don’t worry — the functionality is largely unchanged, and this guide remains up to date.
  :::

## Getting Started {#first-steps}

After you've installed the Panel and its necessary components, the admin interface will be accessible through browser — navigate to the domain you've assigned the Panel to.

First, you need to create a user. The first user to register automatically becomes the "super-admin."

:::tip Tip
If you ever forget your password, you can always recreate the super-admin account using the Rescue CLI.

To access the Rescue CLI, use the command: `docker exec -it remnawave remnawave`
:::

## Home Page {#home}

After registration, you will be taken to the main dashboard.

<img src={require('./images/2.webp').default} width="100%" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} alt="Home page" />

Let's break down the elements on this page.

### Remnawave Statistics {#remnawave-stats}

<img src={require('./images/3.webp').default} width="100%" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} alt="Remnawave stats"/>

The first two blocks, `Remnawave Usage` and `Process Details`, show you how Remnawave is currently utilizing system resources.  
In `Process Details`, you can see which internal Remnawave processes are consuming the most resources.
Depending on your configuration, there may be more than one REST-API process.

### Bandwidth Usage {#bandwidth}

<img src={require('./images/4.webp').default} width="100%" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} alt="Traffic usage"/>

This block displays overall traffic usage statistics for all users, with a comparison to the previous equivalent period.
For example, let's consider the `Today` metric. If you open the Panel at 4:00 PM, this block will show statistics from 12:00 AM to 4:00 PM today. However, the comparison will be against the _entire_ previous calendar day (from 12:00 AM to 11:59 PM).

Currently, the screenshot shows all zeros, but after we configure everything and connect a user, this block will reflect real data.

### Users {#home-users}

<img src={require('./images/5.webp').default} width="100%" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} alt="Users"/>

1.  `System` → `Total online on nodes`
    - This displays the total number of online connections across all Nodes. A single user can be connected to multiple Nodes **simultaneously**. This figure represents the sum of all connections on all Nodes, including duplicates.
    - **For example**: If User X is connected to Node A and Node B at the same time, this card will show 2 online connections.
2.  `Online stats`
    - This block displays the total number of unique online users, not counting duplicates.
    - **For example**: If User X is connected to Node A and Node B, this card will show 1 online user.
3.  `Users`
    - This block shows general information about all users.
    - **For example**: If you have two users — User X and User Z — the `Total` will display 2. If User X has an active subscription and User Z’s subscription has expired, then the `Active` and `Expired` counts will show 1 each.

### Navigation Menu {#nav}

On the left side you will see the navigation menu:

1. **Overview** — Contains the `Home` page, which displays high-level statistics and system information. We covered this earlier in the guide.
